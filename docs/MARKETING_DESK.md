# The Marketing desk: one week, one place, Chief in front

Mission Control → Growth → Marketing. This is Solutionist's own marketing,
and the setup that will later ship to businesses. It was streamlined on
2026-10-02 from the design canvas
https://claude.ai/artifact/R4YcBsj9xwtAgyDFsj19pW, which Kevin approved.

## The weekly loop

1. **Thursday 7:00 AM ET: plan next week** (`marketing_engine`). The engine
   reads the numbers and names one problem with the number that proves it. It
   picks plays from a fixed library and saves five posts as drafts, each with
   a flyer. Monday to Wednesday it plans the rest of the current week only if
   that week was never planned. It never plans overnight.
   - Before this release, `week_window` rolled to next week only once fewer
     than two posting times were left. That made every plan land on Thursday
     at 10:00 by accident, while the desk said "Monday 7:00".
2. **Chief tells the owner** (`marketing_desk`):
   - a push (`tell_owner_about_plan`), sent for scheduled plans only, and only
     once for a week that fails;
   - a Today item ("Chief drafted next week. Five posts wait for your OK");
   - Chief's read on the desk, which the drawer also opens with.
   All of it is computed from rows. No model call is made.
3. **The owner decides on the desk.** They can approve the week or one idea,
   ask Chief to change a post, or skip it. Approval stays the owner's alone:
   Chief has no approve action, and `/approve` still binds exact content hashes.
4. **Posts go out at 11:00 AM**, or the desk speaks up. A failed post, an
   unconfirmed delivery, or publishing that is paused while posts are approved
   reaches Today the same hour. `due_tick` pushes once per tick through
   `tell_owner_about_delivery`.
5. **Results.** Every post has its own `/go/` link, and the next plan leans on
   the plays that did well.

## What changed in the backend

- `marketing_desk.py` (new) handles the desk's read, masthead, "Needs a look",
  the Today items, the Chief digest and the pushes.
  - A **post** here means one idea: the same caption on every channel.
  - **Missed** drafts (time passed, never approved) are never counted as
    waiting; they become a "Reschedule or let go" item.
- `GET /platform/marketing/engine` adds `note`, `masthead`, `attention`,
  `deadline` and `relation`. `planning` is now read from the run row, so every
  replica agrees; before, it was a per-process set.
- New endpoints:
  - `POST /platform/marketing/slot/edit` changes one idea's caption and/or
    time on every channel. All posts are checked before any is saved, and
    each goes back to draft.
  - `POST /platform/marketing/slot/cancel` skips an idea or lets missed
    drafts go.
  - `POST /platform/marketing/posts/{id}/not-sent` is the way out for an
    unconfirmed delivery once the owner has checked Buffer.
- `dispatch`: an error before Buffer is reached (a storage blip, a channel
  lookup) puts the post back to `approved`, and the next tick tries again
  until its window closes. A preflight refusal fails it. Only an error once the
  create is under way is `uncertain`. Before, it escaped, and the row went
  `dispatching` → `uncertain` with no exit. A result that cannot be recorded
  is logged and left for the recovery sweep, never re-sent.
- `/slot/edit` and `/slot/cancel` check every channel's revision and state
  before writing anything. A change in the instant between check and write is
  reported channel by channel.
- New posts go everywhere by default (2026-10-02, after a hand-written post
  went to Instagram alone). `POST /platform/marketing/ideas` saves one caption
  for every connected channel in one insert unless `channel_ids` is given,
  leaves Instagram out (and says so) without a picture, and takes the next open
  slot (`GET /ideas/next-slot`: a weekday at 11:00 AM or 3:00 PM Eastern with no
  post at that time) unless `run_at` is given. Chief's `marketing_new_post`
  calls the same function, so Chief makes a post and says where and when,
  instead of asking first.
- The seven-caption generator (`POST /platform/marketing/week`) is retired.
  The weekly plan is the one way a week is drafted.
- Today (`platform_today._marketing`) reads the weekly plan's posts. It used
  to count the platform business's content calendar, a different pipeline, so
  the engine's drafts never reached Today.
- Chief:
  - The Mission Control snapshot carries `marketing` (the digest), and
    `DIGEST_PROMPT` tells Chief to include it in "what needs me?".
  - The marketing drawer adds `marketing_edit_slot` (drafts gate),
    `marketing_skip_slot` and `marketing_replan_week` (marketing_stop gate,
    so the owner approves each on a review card).
  - A rewrite may not add a link, a hashtag or a number the post did not
    already carry.

No migration is needed.

## Before this ships to businesses

What is still platform-only:

- **Storage:** `platform_marketing_config` is a single row (`id = true`). The
  `platform_marketing_*` tables have no `business_id`, and the run id is
  keyed by week alone.
- **Credentials:** there is one `BUFFER_API_KEY` from the environment.
- **Brand and domain are hard-coded:**
  - `mysolutionist.app` in `tracked_link`, `short_link`, `follow`, `LANDING`
    and the news URLs;
  - the flyer footer;
  - `AUDIENCE`, `SYSTEM` and `TZ` in the engine.
- **Signals** come from platform-wide sources: `growth_summary`,
  `founder_offer`, `public_claims`, and `site_events` where
  `business_id is null`.
- **Owner gates:** every route uses `require_owner`; pushes go to
  `PLATFORM_OWNER_EMAIL`.

Tenant social publishing today is separate: Meta only, through
`content_calendar` and `post_approval`.
